The easiest way to start learning about plt is to 
start the sample script plt5.m. Just type <span class="mcode">plt5</span> at the command prompt. This 
simple script plots five traces. Note that he last trace (Line 5) is plotted on 
the right hand axis. Experiment by trying the following:

<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Click on all the objects in the plt window including the trace IDs.
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Try that again with the right mouse button (which usually does something different).
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Click and drag on the x and y axes tick labels (again ... try both left and right buttons)
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Left or right click and drag in the plot area. (On and off the traces do different things).
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Hold down both mouse buttons in the plot area and drag (creates an expansion box).
</ul>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Using plt with some data you are currently working with. Type
      <span class="mcode">plt(x,y)</span> just as you would with Matlab's plot routine.
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Use the plt <a href="Workspace%20plotting.htm">workspace plotter</a> by 
      typing <span class="mcode">plt</span> with no arguments. Then you can 
      interactively select the variables you wish to plot.
