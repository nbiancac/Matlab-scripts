Matlab users will be interested in &nbsp;<span class="mcode"><b>plt</b></span> &nbsp;for its focus in one or both of these areas:
<ol>
<li><h3>A plotting interface. <i>An alternative to Matlab's
        <span class="mcode">plot</span> and <span class="mcode">plotyy</span> routines</i></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Like plot, plt commands can be typed at the command prompt to display your workspace arrays. 
        For simple commands the interface is the same.
    <li>Optimized for data exploration.
    <li>Improved zooming, panning,&nbsp;linear/log toggling, &amp; auto-scaling controls.
    <li>You can interactively select which variables to plot (workspace plotting).
    <li>Automatically generates a legend that also provides trace selection controls.
    <li>Up to 999 traces on a single axis. (Limited to 99 traces if a legend is required).
    <li>Fast and easy cursor movement with delta, rms, mean, y/x, and magnitude readouts.
    <li>Support for dual y-axes and sub-plots, each with individual cursor control &amp; readout.
    <li>Peak/Valley finder, display expansion history, and support for metric prefixes.
    <li>Better looking grid lines with selectable color and style.
    <li>Interactive editing of trace properties, figure colors, and annotations.
    <li>Data editing (mouse or keyboard driven).
    <li>Regular updates based suggestions from users.
    <li>Perhaps the most significant advantage of plt over plot is the consistency and flexibility
        of the command line interface, all explained in a single document with example code for
	every important option. Never again will you have to hunt for the many obscure handle
	graphics commands scattered throughout the Matlab documentation.<br><br>
</ul>

<li><h3>A GUI building framework. <i>An alternative to Matlab's <span class="mcode">guide</span></i></h3>
<ul><li>Provides a framework for developing graphical user interfaces, usually involving 2D plotting
    <li>Provides these <font color="#0077dd"><i><b>pseudo objects</b></i></font> (collections of Matlab
        graphical objects with a single purpose):
        <table>
	  <tr><td><ul>
	     <li><b>cursor &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
             <li>grid
             <li>plt</b>
	  </ul></td>
	
	  <td><ul>	  
	    <li><b>slider
	    <li>popup
	    <li>edit object
	    <li>color picker</b>
          </ul></td></tr>
	</table>
    <li>Provides these <font color="#0077dd"><i><b>auxiliary functions</b></i></font> which perform tasks
        commonly needed in plot oriented GUIs:
         <table>
	  <tr><td><ul>
	     <li><b>prin
             <li>datestr &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
             <li>metricp</b>
	  </ul></td>
	
	  <td><ul>	  
	    <li><b>Pvbar
	    <li>Pebar
	    <li>Pquiv</b>
          </ul></td></tr>
	</table>
        
    <li>The capability to move and resize the pseudo objects and native Matlab objects while
        recording the positions so that they can be made permanent.
    <li>A methodology for combining these elements presented with a series of examples &amp; demo programs.
        Most of these demo programs are designed merely as examples of the use of the various pseudo objects,
        however a few of them have significant educational value in their own right (in the signal processing
        field). This includes <b>editz.m</b>, <b>winplt.m</b>, and <b>gui2.m</b> (z-plane analysis, fft windows,
        and classical analog filters respectively)
</ul>
</ol>

<span class="mcode">plt.m</span> and all example code has been extensively 
tested and verified to run under all Matlab releases from 12.1 (ver 6.1) to R2014b using Windows&nbsp;7, 
Vista, and Windows&nbsp;XP. Brief testing has also been done under Windows 8, the Mac and other Unix
based platforms.

<br>I hope using plt enhances your Matlab experience.
<br>I'm interested in hearing about your problems and suggestions.
