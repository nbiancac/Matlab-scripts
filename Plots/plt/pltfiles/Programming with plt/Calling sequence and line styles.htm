<br><h1>Calling sequence and line styles</h1> <br clear="left"><br><br>

<i>Note: The strings in the cursor and auxiliary commands are case sensitive. All 
other plt string arguments are case insensitive.</i>
<br><br>

If no arguments are specified, plt will display the
<a href="../Quick%20start/Workspace%20plotting.htm">workspace plotter</a>. For 
plt to plot data without using the workspace plotting interface there must be at
least one argument specifying the y-values to be displayed. More often you will call plt with two arguments:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt(x,y);</span>
<br><br>
This plots the data in vector x along the horizontal axis and the data in 
vector y along the vertical axis. x and y may be row or column vectors. plt 
will transpose one of the arguments if needed to line things up, so x could be a 
row vector while y was a column vector. x and y must be the same length however. 
If not you will get an error message saying that the vectors must be the same 
length.
<br><br>
If y is a real vector, <span class="mcode">plt(y)</span> is equivalent to
<span class="mcode">plt(1:length(y),y)</span>.
<br><br>
To plot more than one trace include the x and y vectors for each 
trace in the argument list. For example </nobr><span class="mcode">plt(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3)</span></nobr>
plots three traces. Quite often several traces share the same x vector.
In this case we can simply repeat the x vector in the 
argument list, as in <span class="mcode">plt(x,y1,x,y2,x,y3)</span> or a 
shorthand way of writing that is </nobr><span class="mcode">plt(x,[y1;y2;y3])</span></nobr>. 
That would work only if the y1,y2,y3 were row vectors. If they were column 
vectors you would need to write <nobr><span class="mcode">plt(x,[y1 y2 y3])</span></nobr>.
<br><br>
You can call <span class="mcode">plt</span> using an output argument, which will return a column vector of trace handles. 
So for example adding an output to the previous command:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">h = plt(x,[y1 y2 y3])</span>
<br><br>
will return a 3 by 1 column vector <span class="mcode">h</span> of handles.
<span class="mcode">h(1)</span> of course would be the line handle associated with the y1 trace.
Most often when you type the plt command at the command prompt you don't need to save plt's return value. 
However when plt is called from a program the line handles are often required to 
allow further manipulations of the plot.
<br><br>
If <span class="mcode">x</span> and <span class="mcode">y</span> are both 
matrices of the same size, <span class="mcode">plt(x,y)</span> will create one 
trace per column.
<br><br>
<i><b>None of this so far should come as a surprise since it is identical to 
Matlab's <span class="mcode">plot</span> command.</b></i>
<br><br>
Also like plot, if y is a complex vector, <span class="mcode">plt(y)</span> is equivalent to
<span class="mcode">plt(real(y),imag(y))</span>. Unlike plot however, complex 
arguments are treated this way no matter where they appear in the argument list. 
For instance if a and b are both complex, <span class="mcode">plt(a,b)</span> is 
equivalent to&nbsp;
<span class="mcode">plt(real(a),imag(a),real(b),imag(b)).</span> This doesn't 
work with <span class="mcode">plot</span> for some reason.
<br><br>
Also like the plot command you can include any line property in the argument 
list. For example:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt(x,y,'LineWidth',2)</span> is equivalent to<span class="mcode"> set(plt(x,y),'LineWidth',2)</span>
<br><br>
One difference in the behaviors of plt and plot is that with plot these line 
properties must appear after all the data vectors in the argument list. (plot gives an error otherwise). With plt the line properties may 
occur in the middle of the argument list. In that case, the line property is 
applied only to the lines defined earlier in the argument list. For example:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt(x,[y1;y2],'Marker','Diamond',x,[y3;y4]);</span>
<br><br>
only sets the Marker property for the first two traces. An equivalent to the 
above is:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">a=plt(x,[y1;y2;y3;y4]); set(a(1:2),'Marker','Diamond');</span>
<br><br>
By using cell arrays, you can set properties differently on each trace. For example:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt(x,[y1;y2;y3;y4],'LineWidth',{2 2 4 2});</span>
<br><br>
This would set the LineWidth of the trace associated with y3 to 4 and the 
other three traces to 2. A column (<span class="mcode">{2;2;4;2}</span>) would 
have worked equally as well. The number of elements in the row or column vector 
must identical to the number of traces defined so far in the argument list. (so 
as above, traces defined after the LineWidth parameter will just be assigned to 
the default LineWidth. Two more examples are:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt(x,[y1;y2;y3;y4],'LineStyle',{'-' ':' '-.' 'none'});
<br><br>
plt(x,[y1;y2;y3],'Marker',{'square','none','+'});</span>
<br><br>
Note that this method of assigned properties applies to any line property. In 
the two particular line properties used above, you could have replaced <span class="mcode">
'LineStyle'</span> with <span class="mcode">'Styles'</span> 
and <span class="mcode">'Marker'</span> with <span class="mcode">
'Markers'</span> and the results would be the same. Styles and Markers are not 
really line properties, however plt allows you to use those alternate forms to 
allow some additional flexibility in how you write the parameter that follows 
it. (For example a character array may be used in place of the cell array.)&nbsp; The
details of the additional flexibility provided by using 
these two alternate parameters are described in the
<a href="Trace%20properties.htm">Trace properties</a> section.
<br><br>
The special plot types vertical bars, error bars, and vector fields (arrows) 
are plotted with the help of auxiliary functions Pvbar, Pebar and Pquiv. The use of 
these functions is described in the <a href="Auxiliary%20functions.htm">
Auxiliary functions</a> section.

<h3>Figure application data:</h3>

After a call to plt, the following information is available from the figure application data:<br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" vspace="12" bordercolor="#9999ff">
  <tr>
    <td> <span class="mcode">getappdata(gcf,'axis')</span></td>
    <td>Returns a vector of handles of the axes containing the 
    plotted data. The first handle in the vector is the left hand main plot. 
    This is followed by the subplot axes (if any) from the bottom up. Finally, 
    the last element of the vector will be the handle of the main plot right 
    hand axis (if any).</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td> <span class="mcode">get(ax,'user')</span></td>

    <td>Returns the cursor IDs for each axis, starting with the main

    since the main axis cursor also displays data from the right
    hand axis.)</td>

    <td>Each axis (including the right hand axis) also has a 'Lhandles' 
    application data value. This contains a list of all lines contained in that 
    axis. The main (lower) plot is an exception since its Lhandles list includes

        has five traces) and then turn off traces 3 and 4 (by clicking on their trace IDs) then
        this command will return <span class="mcode">[1 2 5]</span> showing that those three traces
        are currently active. You can also use this command with an argument (the functional form only)
        from a program or the command window to set the traces you want active for the

        <span class="mcode">plt('show',2:5)</span> will turn off the first trace while leaving the
        remaining four traces on. Note that the TraceIDs will change their appearance to
        indicate which traces are enabled just as if you had done the same operation by clicking
        on the trace names in the TraceID box. To disable all traces, use
        <span class="mcode">plt('show','')</span> and to enable all traces, use
