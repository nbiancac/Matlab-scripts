<br><h1>Pseudo objects</h1> <br clear="left"><br><br>
These are functions provided by plt that are associated with plt's GUI building capabilities:
<br><br>

<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#b0b0b0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <h3>grid</h3><i>(pseudo<br>grid line<br>object)</i></td>
    <td>The trace color of the native Matlab axis grid 
    lines can't be independently set leading to grid lines that over power the 
    display. The grid line pseudo object is designed to solve this problem by 
    providing grid lines of whatever color and style you choose. Grid lines are
    positioned at each tick label. Additional (sub-decade) grid lines will also
    be used for logarithmically scaled axes that span six or fewer decades. (The
    six decade limit may be changed by adjusting the <span class="mcode">logTR</span>
    figure application data property which defaults to <span class="mcode">1.0e6</span>)
    <br><br>
    <b>The grid line functions are:</b>
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax,'init',color,erMode,LineStyle,In7,In8,In9,In10)</span><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; Initializes grid lines on axis
            <span class="mcode">ax</span> of color <span class="mcode">color</span>
            with erase mode <span class="mcode">erMode</span>
            and LineStyle <span class="mcode">LineStyle</span>.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;<span class="mcode">color</span> is optional with default [.13 .13 .13]<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;<span class="mcode">erMode</span> is optional with default 'xor'.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;<span class="mcode">LineStyle</span> is optional with default '-'<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;<span class="mcode">In7,In8</span> is an optional parameter/value pair to apply to the grid lines<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;<span class="mcode">In9,In10</span> is an optional parameter/value pair to apply to the grid lines
    
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax,'toggle')&nbsp; </span>- toggle grids (on/off)
    <br><br>    
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax,'get')  &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>- get current on/off state of grids
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax,'off') &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>- turn grids off
    <br><br>    
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax,'on') &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>- turn grids on
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax,'update') &nbsp;</span>- update grids
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>- update grids (same as above)
    <br><br>
    All the above calls return 1 if the grids are on and 0 otherwise.<br>
    To experiment with these functions, try typing this at the command prompt:
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">&gt;&gt; a = axes; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </span> % create axis<br>
    <span class="mcode">&gt;&gt; plt('grid',a,'init');&nbsp; </span> % draw grid lines<br>
    <span class="mcode">&gt;&gt; set(a,'ylim',[0 6]); &nbsp; </span> % change axis limits<br>
    <span class="mcode">&gt;&gt; plt('grid',a); &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> % update grid lines
    <br><br>
    The <span class="mcode">pltvbar.m </span> demo program uses the grid pseudo object to create a
    tabular list next to the main plot area.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <h3>edit</h3><i>(pseudo<br>edit<br>object)</i> </td>
    <td>Sometimes a GUI needs many numeric and character controls in a small space. 
        Matlab's usual <span class="mcode">
        uicontrol('Style','Edit')</span> controls may be used but they use up so 
        many extra pixels that a complicated GUI will quickly become overly cluttered. 
        The <span class="mcode">
        edit</span> function of plt fills this need. With numeric controls, we often 
        would like to change the value by small amounts quickly and repeatedly. Matlab's 
        slider control (or plt's slider object described below) fills this need well, 
        however both take up too much space to use many of them is a single GUI. For 
        this reason, several features of the plt edit pseudo object are tailored specifically 
        for incrementing and decrementing numeric controls.
        <br><br>
    There are two types of edit pseudo objects:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Type 1:</b> Two uicontrol objects are created (text style) inside the current figure.
             <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
            <font size="-1"><i>(If a label is not specified, only a single uicontrol is created.)</i></font>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
            This type is created if the 'pos' property has length 4 ([x y width height]).
      <li><b>Type 2:</b> Two text objects are created inside the current axis.
           <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
             <font size="-1"><i>(If a label is not specified, only a single text object is created.)</i></font>
         <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
             This type is created if the <span class="mcode">'pos'</span> property value has length 2 ([x y]).
    </ul>
        For reference, this first table describes the edit pseudo object properties that you may set and query.
    How to use these properties will become clear later when the commands are discussed:<br>
        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" vspace="8" hspace="20" bordercolor="#9999ff">

           </tr></table>
           Except for the length 2 argument case, the callback function is called
           if it has been provided earlier in the argument list or in a previous
               call to <span class="mcode">plt('edit')</span>.
      </td>

              8192 times the edit text handle.</td>

          <td align="center"><span class="mcode">enable</span></td>
          <td>0=disable, 1=enable (default=1). If disabled, the text will 
              still be visible, but may not be modified.</td>
        </tr> <tr>
          <td align="center"><span class="mcode">incr</span></td>
          <td>The increment value for a numeric edit pseudo object. (default&nbsp;=&nbsp;1)
          When you click on the right/left side of the center of the object,
              the value of the pseudo edit object is increased/decreased by &quot;incr&quot;.
              A negative value of "incr" is used to indicate that the increment factor
              is in percentage terms instead of absolute. For example, if incr&nbsp;=&nbsp;-0.1
          then clicking on the right/left side of the edit object will increase/decrease
              the edit object's value by 0.1 percent (i.e. from 1000 to 1001 or 999).
              Setting incr to zero disables the incr/decr feature which means the left
              clicking on the object will have the same effect as right clicking. Note
              that the incr/decr feature is also disabled if the length parameter
              (below) is set to anything other than one.</td>
        </tr> <tr>
          <td align="center"><span class="mcode">length</span></td>
          <td>The length of the vector allowed as the edit value. Usually 
              length=1 indicating the edit value must be a scalar. If length=4 (for 
              example), an allowed edit value must be a row or column vector of length 4. 
              Two special cases are length=-1 and length=0. length=-1 is used to indicate 
              that a numeric array of any length is a legal value. length=0 is used for 
              string edit objects i.e. the edit string is not interpreted as a number or 
              vector. (default&nbsp;=&nbsp;1)</td>

          <td align="center"><span class="mcode">format</span></td>
          <td>The format conversion string used to display numeric edit 
              objects (default&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="mcode">'%6w'</span>).
              Type "help prin" for a description of the formatting codes.</td>
    </tr>  <tr>
          <td align="center"><span class="mcode">label</span></td>
          <td>If the argument is a string, that string will become the edit pseudo object's label.
          Usually this is sufficient, but if you want more control of the label's position or
          appearance the argument may be a cell array of the form:<br>
              <span class="mcode">{'LabelString', offset, 'Property1',Value1,'Property2',Value2, ...}</span>
          <br><br>
          Note that the label will be created with the same type as the main edit object (i.e. a uicontrol
          for type 1 and a text object for type 2). The property names in the cell array must be
          valid properties for that object type.
         <br><br>
          Note that the label will be created as a text object in the same axis that is used to display
          the popup choices. Property1, Property2, etc. must all be valid text object property names.
          The meaning of the offset parameter depends on its length as follows:
          <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" vspace="8" hspace="8" bordercolor="#b0b0b0">

          of the edit pseudo object must be set this way.

          (<span class="mcode">'foregr'</span>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<span class="mcode">'backgr'</span> properties)
          are usually set this way, however if these properties are not specified the background color
          defaults to 0.8 times the figure background color and foreground color defaults to
          [1&nbsp;1&nbsp;.4] or [0&nbsp;0&nbsp;.6] (whichever provides the most contrast).
          The text color of a type 2 edit pseudo object can be
          set this way as well (<span class="mcode">'color'</span> property) with its default

        Right clicking on the edit text object always &quot;opens&quot; the object for editing. 
        What this means is that the old edit string  appears with the cursor (underscore) 
        at the end of the string indicating that it is ready to accept keys typed at the

        other than the end, simply move the cursor to the desired point using the 
        left/right arrow keys. To remove characters, press &lt;Backspace&gt; or &lt;Delete&gt; to 
        remove a character before or after the cursor. Pressing &lt;Delete&gt; when the cursor 
        is at the end of the string deletes all the characters. This special case makes 
        it easier to enter a new string that bears little resemblance to the previous 
        entry. Note that while typing, the text object is shown in a different color to 
        remind you that a new value is being entered. When you press &lt;Enter&gt;, the new 
        string is accepted and the color returns to the original. If you type an invalid 
        entry, the word &quot;error&quot; will appear. Click again on the &quot;error&quot; string to try 
        the entry again or to recover the previous entry (via &lt;Esc&gt;). A summary of the 
        special keys follow:

              text object value from before the object was opened is retained.</td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        Left clicking on the edit text object also opens the object for editing 
        except for one important exception. This exception happens when the edit text
        object is a scalar (i.e. the length parameter is equal to one). In fact this is
        more the rule than the exception since that is the most commonly used
        (and default) value for the length parameter.
        <br><br>
        In this (scalar parameter) case, when you left click on the edit text object, its 
        value is incremented or decremented by the object's &quot;incr&quot; parameter. Whether 
        the value is incremented or decremented depends on the position of the mouse 
        click. If you click to the right of the edit object's center, the value will 
        be incremented. Likewise, the value will be decremented for clicks to the left 
        of center. As an example, suppose the current edit text object has a value of 
        259, and the increment parameter is 1. Left clicking on the 9 will change the 
        edit object's value to 260 (because the 9 is right of the center of the text 
        string). On the other hand, left clicking on the two will decrement the value 
        by one. Remember that if the increment amount is not convenient, you can change
        the increment amount on the fly by using the "i" character as described above.
        <br><br> 
        An important property of the scalar increment/decrement feature is that the edit object
        will continue to increment as long as you hold down the mouse button. This is useful
        for many interactive controls and allows the edit objects to take the place of sliders
        (the only other handle graphic object to have this repeat property). When you hold down
        the mouse button, there will be a delay of 0.4 seconds before the auto-incrementing
        begins. After that delay, the value will be incremented once every 0.03 seconds.
        You can alter the repeat rate by setting the figure application data
        <span class="mcode">repeat</span> property. For example, to halve the repeat rate use
        <span class="mcode">setappdata(gcf,'repeat',0.06);</span>. You can also change the default
        repeat delay as well. For example, the following command changes the repeat rate to
        0.06 seconds and the repeat delay to 0.25 seconds: 
        <span class="mcode">setappdata(gcf,'repeat',[0.06 0.25]);</span>
        <br><br>   
        Whenever a number is being typed in, you may also type an expression 
        instead. For example, the following entries are all equivalent:
    <ul> <li><span class="mcode">5</span>
             <li><span class="mcode">abs(3+4i)</span>
             <li><span class="mcode">[2&nbsp;1] * [2&nbsp;1]'</span>
             <li><span class="mcode">sqrt(3*2^3-cos(pi))</span>
        </ul>
        Typing <span class="mcode">sum(get(gca,'xlim').*[0&nbsp;1])'</span>would be equivalent
    to typing in the current upper x axis limit. And to be really perverse, typing
    <span class="mcode">log(-1)/(2*pi)</span> would be equivalent to typing
    &quot;.5i&quot; which as mentioned above would change the auto increment value to one half.

          If any (or all) of the four coordinates are negative then the roles of the left and right click
          actions described under "Mouse behavior" below are reversed. This is called the "super-button" mode
          since it behaves much like a smart button. In fact if you only supply a single string in the choices argument,
          then it behaves almost exactly like a uicontrol button except that the callback will execute
          repeatedly when the mouse is held down. Normally the edge color is set to 'none', but in super-button
          mode the edge color is set to [.1 1 .9] to give it a more button like character. You may change that
          color or set it back to 'none' by using the 'edge' property inside the 'pop' command.

          left/right edges of the opened popup). The meaning of the y variable becomes clear by considering
          the example where the choices cell array contained 4 elements. Then:
          <ul>
        <li><span class="fx">y = 0: &nbsp; </span> represents the vertical position of the bottom of the opened popup
        <li><span class="fx">y = 0.5: </span> represents the vertical position of choice{1} of the opened popup
        <li><span class="fx">y = 1.5: </span> represents the vertical position of choice{2} of the opened popup
        <li><span class="fx">y = 2.5: </span> represents the vertical position of choice{3} of the opened popup
        <li><span class="fx">y = 3.5: </span> represents the vertical position of choice{4} of the opened popup
        <li><span class="fx">y = 4.0: </span> represents the vertical position of the top of the opened popup
          </ul>
          Note that negative values for x or y may be used to indicate that the closed popup position should be
          to the left of or above the position of the opened popup.
          <br><br>

          i.e. at position <nobr><span class="fx">[0.08 n]</span></nobr> (where n is the number of popup choices).
          There are two ways to put the closed popup at the bottom of the opened popup. The obvious way is to
          simply include <span class="mcode">'offset',0 </span>in the parameter list. The second way (which is
          left over from before the offset parameter was added) is to make the first coordinate of the position
          vector negative. Note that the negative number is not actually used as a position coordinate since
          the absolute value of the array is taken before setting the position. (The second method is more
          concise but too cryptic to be recommended.)

          <td>Normally a left click on the pseudo popup control opens the popup to reveal the list of choices
          while a right click merely advances to the next choice without opening the popup. Sometimes it is
          useful to reverse the roles of the left and right click - a mode I refer to as the "super-button"
          mode. In fact if there is only a single choice, it behaves exactly like a uicontrol button in that
          the only effect from clicking on it is that its callback is called. If there are two choices in
          the choices cell array, it behaves similarly except that the button text toggles between the two
          choices with every click. Usually if there are fewer than four choices, the super-button mode is
          more convenient than the regular mode. The super-button mode is selected by including the swap
          parameter in the argument list. Often you will want to make the super-button look at least somewhat
          like a button by including a box around the super-button text. The color of this box is specified
          by the swap parameter. For example <span class="mcode">swap,'blue'</span> will draw a blue box around
          the button text. Or instead of a Matlab color string, you can use an [r g b] color triple. Set the
          parameter to zero to use the current foreground color (which defaults to [.1 1 .9]). If the parameter
          is missing (which is only possible if the 'swap' argument is at the end) or if the parameter is
          set to <span class="mcode">''</span> or <span class="mcode">[]</span> or <span class="mcode">'none'</span>
          then no box is drawn around the button text. A second method of selecting the super-button mode
          is to use a negative number for the second element of the position vector. Doing so has the same effect
          as including <span class="mcode">swap,0</span> in the argument list. (The second method is left over
          from before the swap parameter was added. It's more concise but too cryptic to be recommended.)
          Sometimes it is useful to be able to toggle the super-button mode on or off interactively. This is
          possible with the following quick procedure:
          <ol><li>First open the popup. (A left or a right click will do this, depending on which mode you are in.)
              <li>Then use the mouse to move the figure window a very small amount (less than 15 pixels
                  in any direction).
              <li>And finally close the popup by clicking on any of the choices in the drop down list.
          </ol>
          The 15 pixel requirement makes it quite unlikely that this action is performed unintentionally,
          especially since one rarely thinks of moving the figure while adjusting a control. The
          text<span class="mcode"> swap toggled </span>will appear in the Matlab command window to assure
          you that the operation worked as intended.</td>

          objects are shown again (unless they were hidden before the popup opened). The hide parameter is

          If there is a zero in the list, before the list is used the zero will be replaced with the
          handle (or handles) of the plot grid lines. (This is convenient because grid lines are the
          most common object to overlap with opened popups.) Also setting the hide parameter to
          <span class="mcode">''</span> or <span class="mcode">[]</span> or not supplying a parameter

          A label for the popup will be created as a text object in the same axis that is used to display
          the popup choices and will contain the string 'LabelString' (the first element of the cell array argument).
          The 2nd element of the cell array is a complex number containing the offset for the label position in pixels
          from the closed popup. (The real part is the x offset and the imaginary part is the y offset). For example
          if the 2nd element of the cell array is -10+20i, then the label will be positioned 10 pixels to the left
          and 20 pixels above the closed popup.
          <br><br>
          The remaining cell array elements (if any) must contain property/value pairs, and the properties must be valid
          text object property names. The specified properties will be applied to the closed popup text string.
          <br><br>
          Specifying an offset of <span class="mcode">''</span> or <span class="mcode">[]</span> is equivalent to
          specifying the number 5 for this cell array element. (i.e. the default offset is 5 pixels to the left.)
          <br><br>
          Instead of specifying a cell array for the label argument, you may also specify a string. For example,
          the argument <span class="mcode">'LabelString'</span> is equivalent to
          </nobr><span class="mcode">{'LabelString',''}</span></nobr>. Since the default offset is usually sufficient,

        Left clicking on the popup text object &quot;opens&quot; the popup. What this means is 
        that the popup string is replaced by a list of the popup choices (rendered using 
        colorfr/colorbk). The user then clicks on the desired choice which then becomes 
        the new text string. Right clicking on the popup text object changes the text 
        string to the next available choice. If the last choice is already selected, 
        then right clicking will change the text string to the first available choice 
        (in the &quot;choices&quot; array). If you hold down the right mouse button, the
    selection will continuously advance cyclically. You can alter the rate at which
    the cycling proceeds by setting the figure application data

    <td>To use a slider to enter a numeric value in a gui application, besides the 
        slider object itself one generally also wants an edit box to show the current 
        slider value as well as to allow data entry by typing the number. Usually a 
        label is required to identify the data and two fields that indicate the minimum 
        and maximum values allowed are also handy. The pseudo slider object combines 
        these five objects into one and is included in plt since many gui applications 
        designed around plt may require sliders. To create a slider pseudo object, use the command:
    <br><br>
        <span class="mcode">H = plt('slider',In1,In2,In3,In4,In5,In6,In7)</span>

              fmin/fmax are formatting strings for the min/max labels and fval is the 
              formatting string for the edit box. These strings may contain c style 
              printf formatting codes or the W,V,w,v formats. (Type "help prin" for a
          description of these formats).
          <br><br>
          You may use a space to delimit the formatting codes.
              For example: <nobr><span class="mcode">'%4w %5.2f %2w'</span>.</nobr><br>
          Or use a row or column cell array if you prefer:
          <nobr><span class="mcode">{'%4w' '%5.2f' '%2w'}</span>.</nobr>
          <br><br>
          Since the w format is the most convenient format to use for this parameter,
          for conciseness a single digit may be used as a shorthand for the w format.
          So the example above may also be written as <nobr><span class="mcode">'4 %5.2f 2'</span></nobr>
          or as <nobr><span class="mcode">{'4' '%5.2f' '2'}</span>.</nobr>
          <br><br>
          Often it is sufficient to only specify the format for fval and accept the
          defaults for fmin and fmax (which are <span class="mcode">'%2w'</span>
          and <span class="mcode">'%3w'</span> respectively). We can
          do this by simply specifying a single format code. For example
              <nobr><span class="mcode">'%5.2f'</span></nobr> is equivalent to
              <nobr><span class="mcode">'2 %5.2f 3'</span>.</nobr>

    <td><img src="../images/ColorPick.png" hspace="10"; vspace="10"; align=left>Although 
    you will probably choose an attractive color scheme for your GUI 
    applications, the user's satisfaction with the application may be 
    greatly improved by allowing them to choose the colors used for the 
    major screen objects. By using the ColorPick pseudo object you allow the 
    user to efficiently choose the screen colors in a consistent way within and 
    among your applications. Also you will find that selecting colors using the 
    ColorPick figure is much easier than using the typical Windows style
    palette which attempts to show all possible colors in a single palette.
    I've found you need to see a fairly large area of your potential color choice
    before you can decide if the color is suitable. It is not possible to accomplish
    that using a single palette which is what makes it frustrating to use. By allowing
    you to fix one of the colors, ColorPick presents an 11x11 palette of choices
    for the remaining two colors which gives you plenty of area for each color block.
    (If that is not enough, you can resize the ColorPick figure to be as large as you want.)
    Even more important is that the instant you click on one of the 121 colors in the
    current palette the larger patch above the palette <b>AND</b> the objects in the gui that you are
    adjusting instantly change to the selected color. This instant feedback is really
    necessary to remove the frustration that usually arises from the task. Scrolling through the
    many possible palettes is also very quick. Just pick any slider and click on the
    left/right arrows for a finely changing palette, or click in the trough area of
    the slider for a more coarsely changing palette (which should be fine enough all
    but the most picky color chooser).
    <br><br>
    Any Matlab object that has either a callback property or a buttondownfunction
    property may be used to bring up the ColorPick window shown here. Before I describe
    how this is done from a programming perspective I will give a few more details about
    how the user selects colors from this window.
    <br><br>
    The text above the sliders is generally used to identify the object or 
    objects that are to receive the color being selected. The three sliders 
    always indicate the RGB values of the currently selected color. In the example
    shown at the left, the RGB values are 
    35%, 80%, and 60% respectively. In Matlab, this color would be represented 
    by the vector [0.35&nbsp; 0.8&nbsp; 0.6]. The large rectangular patch object 
    in the upper right corner always indicates the color that results when the 
    proportions are set to agree with the values of the three RGB sliders. One 
    of the sliders (the red one in this example) will always be shown with its 
    text value in yellow and is referred to as the &quot;active slider&quot;. A slider 
    will become the active slider whenever you either type in a value into its 
    edit box or when you click on the left or right slider arrows. There are 3 
    ways to alter the currently selected color:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>You can simply select the desired color using the RGB sliders. Note that
    with this method it is irrelevant which slider is identified as active.
    <li>You can click on any one of the 121 small square patches that are arranged in an 11x11 grid.
    The colors in this grid are entirely determined by the active slider. In this 
    example, since the active slider shows RED=35%, every color in the 11x11 
    color grid will have red = .35 with varying amounts of the other two colors. 
    So in this example, the colors of the the 4 corners of this grid starting at 
    the lower left and moving clockwise are:<nobr> 
    [.35 0 0], [.35 1 0], [.35 1 1], and [.35 0 1].</nobr> and the square exactly in 
    the middle of this grid has the color <nobr>[.35 .5 .5].</nobr> Clicking on any one of 
    these 121 patches will change the two inactive sliders to the values 
    associated with the patch that you clicked on. (The active slider will be 
    unchanged and will remain active). Also the large patch and all the objects in the
    gui that are associated with this ColorPick object will change to show the new selected color.
    <li>Clicking on the large patch will cause the 
    sliders to move to the &quot;reset&quot; values - i.e. the color that was in effect 
    when the ColorPick window was first opened. Note that this color never 
    changes for as long as the ColorPick window remains open. The reset values 
    may be changed to the values shown currently by the sliders by closing the 
    ColorPick window and re-opening it again.
    </ul>
    Next I will describe how 
    the ColorPick object is created from the programmers viewpoint. I will call 
    the object that initiates the creation of the ColorPick figure window the 
    &quot;main object&quot;. You must do the following two things to make a ColorPick 
    figure appear:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>You must assign an application data variable named <span class="mcode">'m'</span> to the main object with a 
    cell array of this form:
    <br><span class="mcode">{'PROP1', H1, 'PROP2', H2, 'PROP3', H3, ... 'PROPn', Hn, 'label'}</span>
    <br>When the user selects a new color using the 
    ColorPick figure, the 'PROP1' property of the object with handle H1 will be 
    set to the 3 element vector <nobr>[R G B]</nobr> where RGB are the values from the 
    ColorPick figure. If H1 is a row vector of handles, each of the represented 
    objects will be treated similarly. Then in sequence the objects in H2, H3 
    ... Hn are treated in a like manner. If any of the 'PROPi' entries are 
    'str' or 'string', then the numerical 3 element color vector is converted to 
    an ascii string before being assigned to that property. In place of any property
    string, you may use a cell array of strings in which case ColorPick will assign
    the user selected color to all the properties listed in the cell array of all
    the handles listed in the following argument. Finally, the 
    last entry 'label' is optional, and if included will appear above the rgb 
    sliders and is used to identify what screen elements are being controlled.
    <li>To the callback or buttondownfunction property (or both) 
    of the main object you must assign one of the following strings:<br>
    <ol>
    <li><span class="mcode">'plt ColorPick'</span> This will cause the ColorPick 
    figure to be created when the callback or buttondownfunction is called 
    except for one special case - which is when the callback of an 'edit' style 
    uicontrol is called. The reason for this special case is that if you type 
    the desired colors directly into an edit box usually this indicates that you 
    didn't need the help of the ColorPick figure.
    Note that in this special case, the properties listed in the 'm' application 
    data cell array are still modified as described above even though the 
    ColorPick figure is not created. Note that the ColorPick window will appear 
    when you right click on such an edit box if the buttondownfunction of the 
    edit box has been similarly assigned.
    <li><span class="mcode">'plt ColorPick ccf'</span> This has the same effect as above 
        except that when the user changes a color with the ColorPick figure, in 
        addition to changing the properties in the 'm' cell array, the function 
        ccf is called. ccf stands for <em>color change function</em> and may be any string
        corresponding to a function name and may include numerical arguments, such as
        in <nobr>'plt ColorPick changeFunc(3,-1)'</nobr>. In fact the function can have string 
        arguments as well although this is less convenient since you would need 
        two sets of quotes around each string argument. For example
        <nobr>'plt ColorPick changeFunc(''StringArg'')'</nobr>. You should especially avoid color 
        change functions that required a string argument containing spaces 
        although if you really wanted to do that it would be possible with an 
        obscure looking callback such as
        <nobr>'plt(''ColorPick'',''changeFunc(''''A string argument'''')'')'</nobr>
    <li><span class="mcode">'plt ColorPick 0 0'</span> or <span class="mcode">plt ColorPick ccf 0'</span>
    This has the same effect as above except that the special case relating to the edit
    box callback does not apply (i.e. the ColorPick window will be created if every instance).
    </ol>
    </ul>
    Only one detail remains to describe the operation of the ColorPick object, 
    and that has to do with how ColorPick determines the starting positions of 
    the RGB sliders when the window is first opened. This is a two step 
    process. First ColorPick must decide which object will be used to determine 
    the initial color. Once the object is chosen, ColorPick must decide which 
    property of this object to use. Here are the details of these two steps:<br>
    <ol>
    <li><b>Picking the object which will determine the initial color.</b> Usually the 
    handle of the main object will be among one of the handles included in the 
    'm' application data cell array and in this case the main object itself is 
    used to determine the initial RGB slider positions. However sometimes this 
    is not the case. For example, in the demoplt.m program, we would like to 
    open the ColorPick window when we click on the text object &quot;text color&quot; 
    which serves as a label for the text color patch. However since this is just 
    a label, it is not entirely appropriate for the color of this text object to 
    change which means that it will not appear in the list of handles in the 'm' 
    cell array. So in this instance, ColorPick determines the initial color from 
    the object whose handle is the first element of H1 in the 'm' cell array. 
    (This is the only instance where the order of the handles in this array is 
    significant.)
    <li><b>Picking the property of the selected object which determines the initial color.</b>
      <ul>
      <li><i><u>If the selected object is a uicontrol</u></i>. If 
      the uicontrol is an edit box then its 'string' property is always used to 
      determine the initial color. If the string includes fewer than 3 numbers, 
      then extra zeros are added to the end of the vector. If the string includes 
      any numbers that are greater than one, then these numbers are clipped at one 
      and if any numbers are less than zero, then these numbers are clipped at 
      zero. If the uicontrol is not an edit box, then first the 'string' property 
      is examined to see if it represents a valid color vector (i.e. it must have 
      3 elements, all of which are between 0 and 1). If it is valid, than this 
      vector is used as the initial color. If it is not valid, the uicontrol 
      'backgroundcolor' property is used as the initial color.
      <li><i><u>If the selected object is a text object</u></i>, its 'string' property is used if this 
      string translates to a valid color vector. Otherwise the 'color' property of 
      the text object is used.
      <li><i><u>If the selected object is a patch object,</u></i> its 'facecolor' property is used as the 
      initial color.
      <li><i><u>For all other object types</u></i>, the 'color' property is used as the initial color.
      </ul>
