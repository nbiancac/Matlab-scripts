<br><h1>Cursor commands</h1> <br clear="left"><br><br>

<br>The cursor pseudo object, the most complex pseudo object supported by plt, 
consists of one or more markers and several uicontrols with complex 
interactions. Because of this you normally will not create cursor objects on 
your own, but will rely on plt to create them automatically when you specify the 
data to be plotted. However it is possible to create a cursor object manually 
with the cursor init command described at the end of this section. For many 
casual plotting applications, the plt cursors will behave as desired out of the 
box. For more sophisticated applications you may want to modify the cursoring 
behavior using the plt parameters (DualCur, Xstring, Ystring) or the independent
cursor commands shown below.

<h3>DualCur parameter:</h3>
Normally the cursor value for only a single trace (referred to as the active trace) is
shown in an edit box below the plot. However sometimes it is convenient to show the
y-value for two traces simultaneously. This is done by using the <span class="mcode">'DualCur'</span>
parameter which specifies a trace which will always have a display of its y-value on the screen
in addition to the display of the active trace. Try out the
<span class="mcode">editz.m</span> demo program which uses Dual Cursors to simultaneously
display the magnitude and phase of a transfer function. (In fact, transfer
function displays were the problem that inspired the Dual Cursor feature.)
The alternate method of specifying the dual cursor trace (as an offset from the active trace)
is indicated by using a negative number for the DualCur parameter. The demo program
<span class="mcode">gui2.m</span> demonstrates the use of that mode.
The use of the DualCur mode is covered in more detail near the end of the cursoring guide
found here: <a href="../Using%20the%20plt%20window/Cursoring.htm">Cursoring</a>.

<h3>Xstring and Ystring parameters:</h3>
The <span class="mcode">'Xstring'</span> and <span class="mcode">'Ystring'</span> plt
arguments allow you to add text strings just to the right of the cursor X or Y readout values.
Since these strings occupy the same screen area as the delta cursor readouts, they get 
covered up when you are in delta cursor mode (or a if a zoom window is visible). 
However those are usually temporary modes, so as you will see, these strings 
still prove useful. Most of the power of the Xstring and Ystring parameters stem from
their string feature described in the table below. Strings on the left column of this table
are replaced with the value shown in the right column. (Note that Xstring 
and Ystring are both updated every time the cursor is moved.)

<h3>Xstring/Ystring Examples:</h3>

Suppose it was important to see the 
cursor index as well as the usual cursor x and y values (i.e. you want to know 
that your are looking at the sixty fifth data element for instance). You could 
do this as follows:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt(x,y,'xstring','sprintf(&quot;index = %d&quot;,@IDX)');</span>
<br><br>
A string within a string (such as the <span class="mcode">'index = %d'</span>
above) is normally written in Matlab using two consecutive 
single quote characters on both sides of the string. Since this can get verbose 
and confusing at times, callbacks defined within plt may use a double quote 
character instead of two successive single quotes. That's why the double quotes 
appear in the line above.
<br><br>
Although the mean of the active trace 
y values can be shown using one of the usual cursor features, suppose you wanted 
to display the mean of the entire data set (independent of the viewing window). 
Suppose also that you want to continuously display the y/x ratio. (This ratio is 
also a standard cursor feature, but its not continuously visible.) You could 
accomplish both of those feats as follows:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt(x,y,'xstring','sprintf(&quot;mean: %f&quot;,mean(get(@HAND,&quot;y&quot;)))',...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'ystring','prin(&quot;Y/X: %5w&quot;,@YVAL/@XVAL)');</span>
<br><br>
Suppose your x axis is measured in 
seconds with a zero reference of 5pm, 21-Jan-2007 UTC. The cursor x-axis readout 
will be in seconds past the reference, but you may want an additional cursor 
readout that shows the actual time of day. This can be accomplished as follows:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt(t,y,'xstring',...<br>
&nbsp; 'sprintf(&quot;utc:%s&quot;,datestr(datenum(&quot;21-Jan-07 17:00&quot;)+@XVAL/86400,13))');</span>
<br><br>
Note the 86400 (the number of seconds 
in a day) is needed because date numbers are measured in days. If your x axis 
unit was &quot;weeks&quot;, you would replace <span class="mcode">/86400</span> with
<span class="mcode">*7</span>.&nbsp; If you removed the <span class="mcode">,13</span> 
near the end of the line (date string format), then the readout would show the 
complete date and time instead of just the time. Another way to code the 
statement above is:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt(t,y,'xstring','sprintf(&quot;utc: %s&quot;,datestr(@XU+@XVAL/86400,13))');<br>
set(findobj(gcf,'tag','xstr'),'User',datenum(2007,1,21,17,0,0));</span>
<br><br>
The second statement puts the 
reference time in the Xstring user value which is used by plt when updating the 
Xstring. This method is much more convenient when the reference time can change. 
Note that the reference time is identical to that used above, although it's 
written in the vector format instead of the character format.
<br><br>
Sometimes the 1 second resolution provided by <span class="mcode">datestr</span> is
not sufficient. You can increase this resolution to 1 millisecond by using the date
string function provided by plt as follows:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt(t,y,'xstring','sprintf(&quot;utc: %s&quot;,plt(&quot;datestr&quot;,@XU+@XVAL/86400,13))');</span>
<br><br>
Occasionally its useful to use an 
edit box instead of a string for one or both of these customized cursor 
controls. (The <span class="mcode">pltn.m</span> example does this for the Xstring,
although the Ystring is still rendered as a text string.) To do that, simply insert
a question mark before the string. The first example above is rewritten below to use an edit box.
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt(x,y,'xstring','?sprintf(&quot;index = %d&quot;,@IDX)');</span>

      <td>All the cursor commands below may return up to two arguments. If the return
          arguments are listed for a cursor command, the return values will be as specified.
          However if the return arguments are not listed for a particular command, the

<br>
<span class="mcode">[xy k] = plt('cursor',cid,'get','position',n);</span><br>
Get x and y coordinates of the cursor location the last time it was on trace 
#n. The trace number is optional - if it is not specified then the position of 
the active trace is returned. xy is a complex value. Its real part is the cursor 
x-coordinate and its imaginary part is the y coordinate. The second 
return value (if requested) is the index into the x data vector of the cursor 
position.
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">[n h] = plt('cursor',cid,'get','activeLine');</span><br>
Returns the line number of the active cursor. The second return value (if 
requested) is the handle of the active trace.
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">h = plt('cursor',cid,'get','obj');</span><br>
Returns an 13 element vector of handles to the following cursor objects:

<span class="mcode">plt('cursor',cid,'set','xylim',p,pAux);</span><br>
Set new x and y axis limits and update expansion history, where <span class="mcode">p=[xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax]</span>.<br>
and optionally <span class="mcode">pAux=[ymin,ymax]</span> (for the right hand axis).
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt('cursor',cid,'set','expHis',u);</span><br>
Restores an expansion history previously saved in u.
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt('cursor',cid,'set','axisCB',fcn);</span><br>
String <span class="mcode">fcn</span> will be evaluated whenever an axis limit is changed. 
This cursor command overwrites any axis callback function entered using the
<span class="mcode">'axisCB'</span> or <span class="mcode">'NewLimit'</span> parameters on the plt 
command line. The rules for string substitutions and function handles are the 
same as mentioned below in the <span class="mcode">moveCB</span> command.
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt('cursor',cid,'set','moveCB',fcn);</span><br>
String <span class="mcode">fcn</span> will be evaluated whenever the cursor is moved. Before the fcn string 
is evaluated all occurrences of&nbsp; the strings in the 1st column of the table 
above ( <span class="mcode">@CID, @XVAL, @YVAL, @XY, @IDX, @HAND, @LNUM, @XU, 
@YU</span>) are replaced with the values in the 2nd column of that table. fcn is 
not called by events initiated from outside the figure window containing the 
cursor. (For example a button push that moves the cursor in another figure 
window would not activate the callback. This prevents infinite loops when figure A modifies figure 
B's cursor and visa versa.) If you do want to enable the callback for 
external events, insert an extra semicolon as the first character of the moveCB callback string. 
This cursor command overwrites any axis callback function entered 
using the <span class="mcode">'moveCB'</span> parameters on the plt command 
line. In addition to a string, <span class="mcode">fcn</span> may also be a 
function handle of the form <span class="mcode">@func</span> or <span class="mcode">
{@func,arg1,arg2,...,argn}</span>. Note that the string substitutions can't be 
used with the function handle form of this parameter. Also note that a similar 
callback is provided for the TraceID fields, although the string substitutions 
allowed are different than the ones mentioned above. See the <span class="mcode">
'TIDcback'</span> parameter under <a href="Trace%20properties.htm">Trace 
properties</a>.
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt('cursor',cid,'set','activeLine',a,k);</span><br>
Switches the active cursor to the line specified 
by&nbsp; <span class="mcode">a</span> (a must be an integer between 1 and the 
number of lines in the plot). The cursor will be placed at index
<span class="mcode">k</span>. If k (optional) is out of bounds or not supplied,
then the cursor will be placed in the center of the array.
When <span class="mcode">a</span> is zero (a special case), the active line
remains the same and only the cursor index is changed - which would have the the
same as calling the <span class="mcode">update</span> command (below).
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt('cursor',cid,'update',k);<br>plt('cursor',cid,'updateH',k);</span><br>
Moves the active cursor to the index k in the data set and calls any user 
defined cursor callbacks (moveCB, xstring, ystring). If k is out of bounds, the
cursor is set to the middle of the array associated with the active trace.
If you do not supply the argument k, then the command has no effect on the
cursor, and so the only effect is to run the cursor callbacks. If
<span class="mcode">update</span> moves the cursor to an area that is not inside
the current axis limits, it will shift the axis limits to make the cursored data
element visible. However when the cursor is moved by <span class="mcode">updateH</span>
the axis limits will never be adjusted. (Think of this as "Update, Hold".)
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt('cursor',cid,'update',k,x,y);<br>plt('cursor',cid,'updateH',k,x,y);</span><br>
Moves the active cursor to the index k as above. Normally x and y would be
the position of the kth element of the array associated with the active trace,
in which case this command behaves the same as if you didn't include the
last two parameters. However x and y can be any position on the axis, and
the visible cursor marker will be moved to those coordinates. (It's rare
to want to move the cursor off the line, but it may sometimes be useful.)
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt('cursor',cid,'peakval',0);<br>
plt('cursor',cid,'peakval',1);</span><br>
Moves the active cursor to the next peak (<span class="mcode">0</span>) or to
the next valley (<span class="mcode">1</span>)
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt('cursor',cid,'clear');</span><br>
All the cursor objects are deleted.
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">plt hideCur;</span><br>
Has the same effect as right clicking on the y-axis label. See
<a href="../Using%20the%20plt%20window/Cursoring.htm">cursoring</a>. If you also 
want to hide the TraceID box, use the commands
<span class="mcode">tbox=findobj('user','TraceID');&nbsp;set([tbox;&nbsp;get(tbox,'child')],'vis','off')</span>.

<h3>Mouse motion functions:</h3>

If you create a figure with a plt command that includes the parameter <span class="mcode">
'MotionZoom','funcname'</span>, then if you create a zoom box (see
<a href="../Using%20the%20plt%20window/Zooming%20and%20panning.htm">The 
expansion box</a>) while you are adjusting the size of the zoom box the function <span class="mcode">
funcname(0,[x1 x2 y1 y2])</span> will be continually called as the mouse is 
moved (i.e.&nbsp; for as long as the mouse button is held down). The coordinate 
[x1 y1] is the position of the corner of the zoom box that is not moving (i.e. 
where you first clicked to open the zoom box). The coordinate [x2 y2] is the 
current mouse position (i.e. the position of the corner of the zoom box 
diagonally across from the [x1 y1] corner.) It may require some imagination to 
see how using such a parameter would enhance your user interface. The example
<a href="Programming%20examples.htm">demo\gauss.m</a> shows how to use the 'MotionZoom' 
function. Although the use of the MotionZoom feature in this program is not 
inspirational, at least when you create a zoom box inside the gauss figure you 
will see the effect that the MotionZoom parameter creates.
<br><br>
If you create a figure with a plt command that includes the parameter <span class="mcode">
'MotionEdit','funcname'</span>, then if you use the data editing feature&nbsp; 
(see <a href="../Using%20the%20plt%20window/Data%20editing.htm">Data Editing</a>) 
while you are modifying a data value by dragging it with the mouse, the function <span class="mcode">
funcname(0)</span> will be continually called as the mouse is moved (i.e.&nbsp; 
for as long as the mouse button is held down). As with the 'MotionZoom' 
parameter, it may require some imagination to see how to use it to enhance your 
user interface. The example <a href="Programming%20examples.htm">demo\editz.m</a> 
shows one way to use the MotionEdit function to enhance the user interface. In 
this example I think you will be able to see the advantage of the MotionEdit 
function because it is much more impressive and useful when the plots (computed 
from the data being edited) are updated in real time.
    
<h3>Creating a cursor pseudo object:</h3>

Usually the cursor objects are initialized from the main <span class="mcode">
plt()</span> call that specifies the data arrays to be plotted. However you may 
also create the cursor objects using this cursor 'init' call after creating a 
figure on your own (i.e. without using plt).
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">Ret1 = plt('cursor',axis,'init',In1,In2,In3,In4,In5,In6,In7,In8,In9);</span><br>
<p style="margin-bottom: -18">where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="mcode">Ret1: </span>the cursor ID (cid) used to control the cursor with additional calls to plt.
<li><span class="mcode">axis: </span>a scalar if the 
    cursor is assigned to a single axis. A two element row vector is used to assign 
    the cursor to a pair of axes. The second axis (right hand axis) is normally overlayed on 
    top of the primary axis and is used to provide a separate y-coordinate axis on 
    the right and side of the graph.
<li><span class="mcode">In1: </span>a 10 by 4 array containing 
    the positions of the cursor controls. Each row contains [x y w h] where x,y is 
    the position of the control and w,h is its size. The units for all the values in 
    the In1 array must be either pixels or normalized (i.e no mixing units). The 
    last row specifies the position of the slider and is the only optional row. If 
    In1 contains only nine rows then the x-axis cursor slider will not be created. 
    The rows of In1 are assigned as follows:
