  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <h3>Title</h3> </td>
    <td> <span class="mcode">plt(...,'Title',t);<br>
    </span>Inserts the title string <span class="mcode">t</span> above the plot area. The Tex interpreter 
    is used to render the string allowing entry of Greek and other special 
    characters. If you don't want the Tex interpreter to be used, include the 
    string <span class="mcode">[TexOff]</span> anywhere in the title. (The [TexOff] 
    string will be deleted from the title before display). Alternatively you 
    could disable the Tex interpreter after the call to plt using the command:
    <span class="mcode">set(get(gca,'title'),'interpreter','none');</span>
    <br><br>
    Default: no title

  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <h3>LabelX</h3> </td>
    </td>
    <td><span class="mcode">plt(...,'LabelX',s);<br>
    </span>Uses string <span class="mcode">s</span> as the x-axis label. If you 
    are using subplots with two columns, you may also specify the x-axis label 
    for both the left and right columns of plots by using a cell array:
    <nobr><span class="mcode">plt(...,'LabelX',{'left&nbsp;x&nbsp;label'&nbsp;'right&nbsp;x&nbsp;label');</span></nobr>
    <br><br>
    Default: <span class="mcode">'x axis'</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <h3>LabelY</h3> </td>
    <td><span class="mcode">plt(...,'LabelY',s);<br>
    </span>Uses string <span class="mcode">s</span> as the  left hand y-axis label 
    of the main plot. 
    You can specify both the left and right labels by using a cell array. For 
    example, if there are no subplots, <span class="mcode">'LabelY',{'ab' 'cd'}</span> 
    is equivalent to <span class="mcode">'LabelY','ab','LabelYR','cd'</span>. If 
    there are subplots, the right hand axis label must come last. For example 
    with 3 subplots:<br>
    <span class="mcode">plt(...,'SubPlot',[50 20 30],'LabelY',...<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; {'lower-axis' 'middle-axis' 'upper-axis' right-hand-axis'});</span>
    <br><br>
    Default: <span class="mcode">'Y axis (Left)'
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <h3>LabelYR</h3> </td>
    <td> <span class="mcode">plt(...,'LabelYR',s);<br>
    </span>Uses string <span class="mcode">s</span> as the  right hand y-axis label. The <span class="mcode">
    'right'</span> parameter should also be included in this case, however if 
    you don't, plt will default to placing the last trace on 
    the right hand axis. Note that using a cell array argument to the <span class="mcode">
    'LabelY'</span> parameter (described above) is usually a more convenient way 
    to specify the y-axis label, and the <span class="mcode">'LabelYR'</span> 
    parameter is primarily used in legacy code.
    <br><br>
    Default: <span class="mcode">'Y axis (Right)'
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <h3>FigName&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3> </td>
    <td> <span class="mcode">plt(...,'FigName',f);<br>
    </span>Uses string  <span class="mcode">f</span> as the name for the plt figure window.
    <br><br>
    Default: <span class="mcode">'plt'
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <h3>Position</h3> </td>
    <td> <span class="mcode"><nobr>plt(...,'Position',[xLeft yBottom height width]);</nobr>
    <br>
    </span>Specifies the figure size and position on the screen in pixels. If the 
    height is specified as zero, plt will choose a height so that a unit along the 
    x-axis is the same as a unit along the y-axis (i.e.if you plot a circle, it 
    would look like a circle and not an ellipse). If the width is specified as 
    zero, plt chooses the width to meet the same condition. (You can't 
    specify zero for both the height and the width). If you resize the figure 
    window with the mouse, then the units along the x and y axes will no longer 
    be equal (and a plotted circle may appear to be an ellipse). If you wish 
    that the equal units property to be maintained even after the figure window 
    is resized, you should follow the plt command with the command <span class="mcode">
    axis('equal')</span>. If you specify the same position vector for more than 
    one plt command, plt will add a small offset to all the figure window 
    positions (except the first one) so that no two figures are exactly 
    on top of each other. This feature makes it less likely that you will loose 
    track of one of the figures and also makes it much easier to select or move 
    any figure with the mouse. If a second plt command specifies a position that 
    differs from the first plt command by even one pixel, then this feature will 
    not be engaged.
    <br><br>
    Default: <span class="mcode">[9&nbsp;45&nbsp;700&nbsp;525]</span>, or if 
    subplots are enabled:<span class="mcode"> [9&nbsp;45&nbsp;840&nbsp;570]
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <h3>Link</h3> </td>
    <td> This parameter is used to force a group of plt figures to close when any member
    of the group is closed. Consider the following sequence:<br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt(x1,y1);</span><br>
    <span class="mcode">g = gcf;</span><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt(x2,y2,'Link',g);</span><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt(x3,y3,'Link',g);</span><br><br>
    This of course will create 3 plotting figures.
    Closing any one of the three figures will also cause the other two to close.
    The demo programs <span class="mcode">editz.m</span> and <span class="mcode">tasplt.m</span>
    take advantage of this parameter.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <h3>CloseReq</h3> </td>
    <td> This parameter specifies a function that will be run when the plt window is
    closed. The argument may be:
    <ul><li>a string (as shown in the <span class="mcode">plt50.m</span> example).
        <li>a function handle (as shown in the <span class="mcode">gui2.m</span> example).
        <li>a cell array containing a function handle and its arguments
            (as shown in the <span class="mcode">wfall.m</span> example).
    </ul>
    Note that if the function is defined as a string argument, readability can be improved by
    using double quotes to represent two consecutive single quotes (as is true for all
    callbacks defined within plt).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <h3>Fig</h3> </td>
    <td> Normally plt opens a new figure window when it 
    is called. In rare situations one may want to tell plt to use a pre-existing 
    figure instead. This parameter tells plt to do this and specifies which figure
    window should be used.
    This parameter is different from the other parameters in that it only works 
    if it is included as the first argument in the calling sequence. (The 
    parameter is ignored otherwise.) For example, to open plt using figure 
    number 4, you would use <span class="mcode">plt('Fig',4,...);</span></td>
